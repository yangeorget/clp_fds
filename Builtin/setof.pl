%   File   : SETOF.PL
%   Author : R.A.O'Keefe
%   Updated: 17 November 1983
%   Purpose: define setof/3, bagof/3, findall/3, and findall/4


/*  This file defines two predicates which act like setof/3 and bagof/3.
    I have seen the code for these routines in Dec-10 and in C-Prolog,
    but I no longer recall it, and this code was independently derived
    in 1982 by me and me alone.

    Most of the complication comes from trying to cope with free variables
    in the Filter; these definitions actually enumerate all the solutions,
    then group together those with the same bindings for the free variables.
    There must be a better way of doing this.  I do not claim any virtue for
    this code other than the virtue of working.  In fact there is a subtle
    bug: if setof/bagof occurs as a data structure in the Generator it will
    be mistaken for a call, and free variables treated wrongly.  Given the
    current nature of Prolog, there is no way of telling a call from a data
    structure, and since nested calls are FAR more likely than use as a
    data structure, we just put up with the latter being wrong.  The same
    applies to negation.

    Would anyone incorporating this in their Prolog system please credit
    both me and David Warren;  he thought up the definitions, and my
    implementation may owe more to subconscious memory of his than I like
    to think.  At least this ought to put a stop to fraudulent claims to
    having bagof, by replacing them with genuine claims.

    Thanks to Dave Bowen for pointing out an amazingly obscure bug: if
    the Template was a variable and the Generator never bound it at all
    you got a very strange answer!  Now fixed, at a price.

%   findall(Template, Generator, List)
%   is a special case of bagof, where all free variables in the

%   described in Clocksin & Mellish on p152.  The code they give
%   has a bug (which the Dec-10 bagof and setof predicates share)

%   setof(Template, Generator, Set)
%   finds the Set of instances of the Template satisfying the Generator..
%   The set is in ascending order (see compare/3 for a definition of
%   this order) without duplicates, and is non-empty.  If there are
%   no solutions, setof fails.  setof may succeed more than one way,
%   binding free variables in the Generator to different values.  This

%   bagof(Template,Generator,Bag)
%   finds all the instances of the Template produced by the Generator,
%   and returns them in the Bag in they order in which they were found.
%   If the Generator contains free variables which are not bound in the
%   Template, it assumes that this is like any other Prolog question
%   and that you want bindings for those variables.  (You can tell it
%   not to bother by using existential quantifiers.)
%   bagof records three things under the key '.':
%	the end-of-bag marker	       -
%	terms with no free variables   -Term
%	terms with free variables   Key-Term
%   The key '.' was chosen on the grounds that most people are unlikely
%   to realise that you can use it at all, another good key might be ''.
%   The original data base is restored after this call, so that setof
%   and bagof can be nested.  If the Generator smashes the data base
%   you are asking for trouble and will probably get it.
%   The second clause is basically just findall, which of course works in
%   the common case when there are no free variables.
